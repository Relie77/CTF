## TASK-1 There is an open port related to MS SQL Server accessible over the network. What is the port number?

Scan the system using nmap, you will find few open ports.
```
> nmap -T4 -vv <MACHINE_IP>

PORT     STATE SERVICE       REASON
22/tcp   open  ssh           syn-ack
135/tcp  open  msrpc         syn-ack
1433/tcp open  ms-sql-s      syn-ack
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server syn-ack

```
Microsoft SQL Server is open in port ```1433```, i.e default port.

## TASK-2 If the connection is successful, you will get a prompt. What is the prompt that you have received?


If you don't have sqsh installed on your system, run ```sudo apt install sqsh```. After that use this command to connect to the system.<br>
```sqsh -S MACHINE_IP -U sa -P t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp```

SQSH is a command line utility to connect to a relational database. Here the username is <b>sa</b> and the PASSWORD Is <b>t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp</b>.
After you use theses creds to login ```>1``` is the prompt shown.
