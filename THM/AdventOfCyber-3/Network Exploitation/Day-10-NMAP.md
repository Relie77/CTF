## TASK-1  How many ports are open between 1 and 100? 

Scanning the network using the above nmap command ```nmap -sT <IP> -vv``` gives us two open ports.

## TASK-2 What is the smallest port number that is open?

SSH is open on standard SSH port 22. We find it from above nmap command.

## TASK-3 What is the service related to the highest port number you found in the first question?

On port 80 we have an Apache Web Server open, which is vulnerable with <b>LFI</b> and <b>RCE</b>.

## TASK-4 Now run nmap -sS 10.10.208.41. Did you get the same results? (Y/N)

Using <b>Stealth Scan</b> also gives us the same result as the basic default scan.

## TASK-5 What is the version number of the web server?

Scanning the service veresion of the HTTP server gives us, ```Apache Httpd 2.4.49```

## TASK-6 What is the CVE number of the vulnerability that was solved in version 2.4.51?

Try searching for ```Apache Httpd 2.4.49``` in Google. You will find that it is affected by LFI and RCE, which was partially patched in the version<br>
```CVE-2021-41773```. CVE of the patched version is ```CVE-2021-42013```

## TASK-7-8 What is the newly discovered port when scanning all 65535 ports and name of the program running?

Scanning the whole ports with nmap will take hell lot of time. So I scanned with [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) which was pretty fast, and found  port <b>20212</b> open,<br>
hosting <b>Telnet</b> on a LINUX server.

<h3><b>That's it for Day-10. Happy Hacking!</b></h3>
